    <h1>Revitalized Open Source Software</h1>

    <p><i>Placeholder Goal:</i></p>
    <p>To revitalize Abandoned, Legacy Open Source Software</p>

    <p> Current working definition of Abandoned</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Project is not part of an existing community or foundation</li>
        <li>Patches are not being accepted by the upstream source</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Current Working definition of legacy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Upstream is not updated in &gt;= 10 years</li>
        <li>Software is foundational to other pieces of software</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><b>Why did you start this?</b></p>
    <p>I started looking through software running on my computer and discovered libraries and programs that were based on sources that appeared abandoned, with the maintainers of my operating system heavily patching them for use.</p>
    <p><b>What does a revitalized open source project look like?</b></p>
    <p>A successfully revitalized open source project has the following:
    <ul>
        <li>An active Issue Tracker</li>
        <li>Continuous Integration Build system with automated tests</li>
        <li>recent meaningful code changes</li>
        <li>A way to confidentially disclose vulnerabilities</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>I don't want to work on Github, could you use a different platform?</b></p>
    <p>While Github does have a lion's share of the market, some people prefer different platforms. Therefore I have reserved the RevitalizedOSS namespace on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/revitalizedoss">Bitbucket</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://gitlab.org/RevitalizedOSS">Gitlab</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://revitalizedoss.phabricator.com/">Phabricator</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also have the domain revitalizedoss.com, so with donations I could set up additional infrastructure.</p>
