    <h1>Revitalized Open Source Software</h1>

    <p><i>Placeholder Goal:</i></p>
    <p>To revitalize Abandoned, Legacy Open Source Software</p>

    <p> Current working definition of Abandoned</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Project is not part of an existing community or foundation</li>
        <li>Patches are not being accepted by the upstream source</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Current Working definition of legacy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Upstream is not updated in &gt;= 10 years</li>
        <li>Software is foundational to other pieces of software</li>
    </ul>
